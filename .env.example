# You get the discord token at https://discord.com/developers/applications
# Create an application, go to "Bot", click on "Add Bot" and you'll have the token.
# Be sure the "Message Content Intent" is enabled so the bot can read message content.
# Be also sure the "Server Members Intent" is enabled which the bot uses to check if it
# has sufficient permissions to respond to a command.
# To get the invite link, go to "OAuth2" > "URL Generator", click on "bot" and "applications.commands".
# For permissions, at the very least the bot needs
#   - "Read Messages/View Channels"
#   - "Send Messages"
#   - "Read Message History"
#   - "Use External Emojis"
#   - "Add reactions"
# ... which will result in an invite link like
# https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&permissions=330816&scope=bot%20applications.commands
